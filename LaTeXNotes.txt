Commands

Basic
\documentclass{article} %The document always starts with the document class. Other options in addition to article are book, report, etc.
\title{Insert Title} %The title of the document
\author{Name of author} %The author of the document
\date{Insert Date} %The date of the document. \today is used for today's date.

\begin{document}
	\maketitle %The title, the author and the date appear with this command. Otherwise they are not visible.
	....
\end{document} %The document must be written in between these commands

Section levels
\part{...} %Level -1.
\chapter{...} %Level 0. Only for reports and books. In books chapters are orgnanized so that they start on odd pages. In reports chapters can start on any page.
\section{...} %Level 1.
\subsection{...} %Level 2.
\subsubsection{...} %Level 3.
\paragraph{...} %Level 4. It indents properly the paragraph.
\subparagraph{...} %Level 5.
%Sections can be collapsed. This way it is easy to copy, paste and reorganize the document.
% \\ is used to create a new line. It is necessary, otherwise returns are not placed.
\tableofcontents %To be written after the \maketitle command. It must be run twice. The first time, it only creates a .toc file and the second time it reads the .toc file. When creating the table of contents in a book, it considers chapter '0' if there is no chapter. Therefore, sections will be 0.1 and so on.
\section[alias]{...} %Alias to a very large section so that the alias will appear on the table of contents.
Whenever we write commands like \chapter{...}, \section{...}, the title is mentioned in the table of contents that is generated. There are situations when you would not like the entry in ToC. This is achieved by appending a * to the command. For example, consider the commands \chapter*{Introduction} or \subsection*{Time-Table}. There will not be any entry of Introduction and Time-Table in the Table of Contents.
LaTeX denotes different characters for representing the opening and closing of quotes. ` symbol represents the opening of quotes while ' represents the closing of quotes.
Special characters:  \$  \&  \%  \_  \{   \}   \#

Packages
They are mentioned before the document begins, under the documentclass. They help to set the format, such as the page size.
\usepackage[Parameters]{PackageName}
	\usepackage[a4paper, margin=1in]{geometry} %Sets the type of paper and margin. Typer of paper are A0-A5 and B0-B5. Margins are stablished in inches. 
	\usepackage[a4paper, top=1in, left=2in, right=0.75in, botoom=1in]{geometry} %This is used to set different margins.
	\usepackage[inner=1in, outer=2in]{geometry} %When writing a two side document, like a book, this is used to set different margins to the inner part of the book and the outer part of the book.These can be combined with top and bottom.

Page Style: headers, footers and page number
It is placed after the \begin{document} command
\pagestyle{empty} %No page numbers in the footer.
\thispagestyle{headings} %The number in this page is displayed in the header regardless the previous commands.
\setcounter{page}{1} %The pages restart in page 1 in this point. This is useful to do after the table of contents because ideally chapter 1 starts in page 1.
\pagenumbering{roman} %Sets the numbering into roman numbers. To change this at some part of the document it is necesary to rewrite this command to arabic. Different options are arabic (1, 2), roman (i, ii), Roman (I, II), alph (a, b), Alph (A, B)
